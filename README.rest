Overview
========

studio_napi_ is a client library for the `SUSE Studio`_ HTTP API
targetting `Node.js`_.  Two interfaces are exposed, a low-level
and a high-level one.  Both interfaces implement both the admin
and user sides of the API (v2 at the moment).

Status
======

`studio_napi` is in development.  The low-level interface is
implemented to a large extent, the last remaining bits are being
fleshed out; the high-level interface has been designed and we
started the implementation.

Prerequisities
==============

* `Node.js`_ 0.6.x or higher
* NPM_ (any version appropriate for your version of Node.js)
* several packages installable with `npm` (see package.json)


Installation
============

`studio_napi` will appear in the `NPM Registry`_ once it's ready.


Hacking
=======

If you want to hack on `studio_napi`: ::

  git clone https://github.com/roman-neuhauser/studio_napi.git
  cd studio_napi
  npm install
  npm test # or: make check
  # happy hacking

The `npm install` above downloads and installs studio_napi's
dependencies locally (in `./node_modules/`).


Credentials for end-to-end tests
********************************

`make drive` needs to be supplied with a SUSE Studio server URL,
as well as api username and key.
It expects these to exist in files called `cfg/admin` and `cfg/user`.
Templates for these files are in the `cfg/`_ directory.

.. _cfg/: cfg/
